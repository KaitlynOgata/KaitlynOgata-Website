        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Kaitlyn Ogata and I am currently an undergraduate student at UCR studying Biology. For the past year I have been working as a Baker’s Assistant at a bakery/cafe in Riverside, CA. At this job, I have gained experience working with multiple types of pastries including croissants/laminated doughs, sourdough, brioche, cookies, scones, muffins, etc. Working part-time while also attending college full-time has strengthened my time management and organization skills. Especially, it has taught me how to be responsible with my choices and setting myself up for success. This experience, along with my experience in catering and retail businesses, I believe has made me very well-rounded in service-based establishments. It has also developed my interpersonal skills and team/group work abilities. Through these experiences, I have held both leader and team positions, and have identified the strengths that I possess as either positions.
	I began my working life with a part-time catering job in San Francisco, CA. In this job, I was tasked with serving guests, basic prep work, and plating. This job was an entry-level position, but quickly I was given tasks that exceeded my current status. My boss recognized my potential and served as my first mentor in the food industry. She took my under her wing and helped foster the skills that I would bring with me to my later jobs. Initially, I was hired as a server, but after seeing and hearing about my passion for food, my boss began to task me with some of the production. What began as serving and basic prep quickly turned into recipe development and plating.
	After starting college, I took a break from working to focus on my studies. In my second year, I began working at Ross Dress For Less in Riverside, CA. This job was drastically different than my previous job and exposed my to the retail industry. While working at this job, I began as a cashier but was soon promoted to Front-end Supervisor within 3 months of working there. This job taught me how to use a POS system and how to efficiently and effectively assist customers. My biggest take-away from this job was that it showed me that my work ethic was second to none, and that I had potential as a leader.
	At my current job, I work as a Baker’s assistant where I produce a multitude of pastries on a daily basis. Initially, I started this job with little experience in a commercial kitchen. Before working at this bakery, I had previous experience in catering and other service jobs, but not in baking specifically. However, I already had a passion for food and baking that stemmed from my lifelong hobby. In the year that I have been working there I have developed my skills to exceed those who have attended culinary school. While working at this job, my boss and second mentor has taught me more than the basics that I entered the job with. Now I possess the skills and knowledge to run a team and manage daily tasks.
